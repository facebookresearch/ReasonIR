You are tasked with reading and analyzing web pages based on the following inputs: **Previous Reasoning Steps**, **Current Search Query**, and **Searched Web Pages**. Your objective is to extract relevant and helpful information for **Current Search Query** from the **Searched Web Pages** and seamlessly integrate this information into the **Previous Reasoning Steps** to continue reasoning for the original question.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Analyze the Searched Web Pages:**
- Carefully review the content of each searched web page.
- Identify factual information that is relevant to the **Current Search Query** and can aid in the reasoning process for the original question.

2. **Extract Relevant Information:**
- Select the information from the Searched Web Pages that directly contributes to advancing the **Previous Reasoning Steps**.
- Ensure that the extracted information is accurate and relevant.

3. **Output Format:**
- **If the web pages provide helpful information for current search query:** Present the information beginning with `**Final Information**` as shown below.
**Final Information**
